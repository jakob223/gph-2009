  The puzzle given to the solvers is a jumbled audio file with a number of
  musical tracks overlaid on top of one another. Broadway fans will doubtless
  recognize the songs of Lin-Manuel Miranda&rsquo;s major smash hit &ldquo;In
  the Heights&rdquo;, and quickly identify each of the seven songs in the audio
  clip. Each audio clip can be identified as coming from a specific part of the
  song; here&rsquo;s all the songs with the timestamps of the audio clip, in order 
  of their Carlton-Fisk resonance patterns:
  <ul>
  <li>(2:23) It Won&rsquo;t Be Long Now
  <li>(0:53) When You&rsquo;re Home
  <li>(1:31) In the Heights
  <li>(0:41) Alabanza
  <li>(0:31) Inútil
  <li>(1:27) Hundreds of Stories
  <li>(0:43) Sunrise
  </ul>
  As hinted by the flavor text, each of these timestamps is a
  &ldquo;prime&rdquo; number. If you imitate the way that the audio files were
  collapsed into one another, continuing to add the digits of each timestamp
  until you get a single digit, you get the following:
  <ul>
  <li>7 It Won&rsquo;t Be Long Now
  <li>8 When You&rsquo;re Home
  <li>5 In the Heights
  <li>5 Alabanza
  <li>4 Inútil
  <li>1 Hundreds of Stories
  <li>7 Sunrise
  </ul>
  Index each number into the song title, and you get <b>BREATHE</b>.
